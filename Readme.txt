2)For Sorting Algorithm I took help from the source:

To compile and run program use:
gcc -o A3 A3.c -lpthread


Thos propject takes the file IntegerList and splits it into two arrays using pinters.
Pointers are used to sort the whole array(that has been divided ny half)
Each sorting fucntion has one thread
Merging is on another thread
Threads are merged and result displayed in a text file.


This will execute the executable file generated after compiling
